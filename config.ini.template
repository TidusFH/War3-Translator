# Option 1: Use Official Google Cloud Translation API with API Key
# Get your API key from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# Uncomment and add your API key below:
# api_key = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# Option 2: Use Service Account JSON file (Recommended for production)
# Download your credentials JSON from Google Cloud Console
# Uncomment and specify the path to your credentials file:
# credentials_path = path/to/your-service-account-key.json

# Note: If both are empty, the tool will use the free googletrans library
# which doesn't require an API key but has lower rate limits.
